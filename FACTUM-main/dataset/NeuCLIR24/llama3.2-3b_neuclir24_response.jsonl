significant concern, with a notable increase in female suicides compared to the previous year [Source: 1].\n\nIn 2020, Japan reported a rise in suicide rates for the first time in 11 years, with a total of 20,919 suicides [Source: 4]. \nThe number of suicides among women increased by nearly 15% compared to the previous year, with 6,976 women accounting for this increase [Source: 4].\n\nA notable increase in female suicides was observed in October 2020, with a 70% rise in the suicide rate compared to the same month in the previous year [Source: 1].\n\nThe Bond Project, a charity active in suicide prevention, reported that they had intervened in the life of a 19-year-old woman who had attempted suicide multiple times, providing her with a safe place to live and intensive counseling sessions [Source: 1].\n\nThe founder of the Bond Project, June Tachibana, stated that the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed vulnerable people to make a fateful decision, with many people experiencing increased mental health issues and feeling isolated and alone [Source: 1].\n\nThe pandemic has also affected the mental health of children, adolescents, and women, with a study finding that the incidence of accidents decreased in the first half of 2020 due to factors such as subsidies from the Japanese government, reduced working hours, and school closures [Source: 2].\n\nHowever, the second wave of the pandemic, which began in the fall, increased the suicide rate by 16% compared to the first wave [Source: 6].\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from Japanese social services collected during the first and second waves of the pandemic, as well as for similar time periods between 2016 and 2019 [Source: 6].\n\nThe analysis showed that in the first wave, Japanese society reacted to the pandemic in a completely different way than in the second, with suicides decreasing by 14% in the spring of 2020 [Source: 6].\n\nIn contrast, the number of suicides increased by 16% in the summer and autumn of the same year [Source: 6].\n\nThe increase in female suicides during the pandemic was attributed to various factors, including the impact of the pandemic on industries where many women are employed, such as tourism, retail trade, and the food industry [Source: 5].\n\nAdditionally, the pandemic has led to an increase in the number of single women living on their own, with many preferring such a life to marriage, which still assumes traditional gender roles [Source: 5].\n\nThe pandemic has also affected the mental health of women, with a study finding that the number of lost jobs among non-permanent workers increased significantly over the past eight months [Source: 5].\n\nFurthermore, the pandemic has led to an increase in domestic violence cases, with a 37% increase in the suicide rate of women who have experienced domestic violence [Source: 2].\n\nThe Japanese government has taken steps to address the issue, with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga appointing a \"Minister for Solitude\" to address the worsening suicide problem [Source: 4].\n\nThe Minister for Solitude, Tetsuji Sakamoto, has established the \"Office of Solitude and Isolation Measures\" to deal with the serious problem of loneliness and isolation [Source: 4].\n\nThe pandemic has also affected the lives of families of suicide victims, with many feeling guilty and unable to mourn their loved ones [Source: 5].\n\nThe lack of social interaction and the increased pressure on women to care for their families have contributed to the increase in female suicides during the pandemic [Source: 5].\n\nIn conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on suicide rates in Japan, with a notable increase in female suicides compared to the previous year [Source: 1].\n\nThe pandemic has affected various factors, including industries where many women are employed, the number of single women living on their own, and the mental health of women [Source: 5].\n\nThe Japanese government has taken steps to address the issue, with the appointment of a \"Minister for Solitude\" and the establishment of the \"Office of Solitude and Isolation Measures\" [Source: 4].\n\nIt is essential to continue monitoring the situation and taking steps to prevent the number of suicides from increasing in the future [Source: 6].\n"}

cities [Source: 5].\n\nOne of the primary benefits of pocket parks is their ability to provide citizens with easy access to green spaces, even in densely populated areas [Source: 5]. \nAccording to Liu Yuelai, a scholar at Tongji University's School of Architecture and Urban Planning, there is currently no clear definition of the size of a pocket park, but they can be as small as tens of square meters or as large as thousands of square meters [Source: 5].\n\nPocket parks can also serve as a refuge against the stresses of urban living, providing a peaceful oasis for citizens to relax and recharge [Source: 5]. \nFor example, the pocket park in Hongkou District, built after the demolition of illegal buildings, has become a popular spot for residents to take a break from the hustle and bustle of city life [Source: 5].\n\nIn addition to providing citizens with access to green spaces, pocket parks can also play a role in promoting physical activity and healthy lifestyles [Source: 5]. \nAccording to Fang Yan, deputy director of the municipal greening and cityscape administration bureau, the goal of allowing citizens to go out 500 meters to see a 3,000 square meter park green space has been basically achieved [Source: 5].\n\nPocket parks can also serve as a catalyst for community engagement and social interaction [Source: 3]. \nIn the Luhansk region, the creation of a network of sports grounds is part of a larger effort to promote socialization and community involvement [Source: 3]. \nThe Luhansk region's innovative portal aims to promote the region and encourage citizens to participate in outdoor activities [Source: 3].\n\nFurthermore, pocket parks can help to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on the environment [Source: 4]. \nAccording to Yahya Sotoudeh Nia, the creation of small parks in urban areas can help to offset the lack of green spaces and provide a refuge for citizens [Source: 4].\n\nIn terms of design, pocket parks can be tailored to meet the needs of local communities and provide a range of features and amenities [Source: 5]. \nFor example, the pocket park in Cao Jia Street, built in Shanghai, features three leisure seats and small outdoor fitness equipment [Source: 5].\n\nOverall, small \"pocket parks\" in high-density urban settings offer a range of benefits for fostering more sustainable and resilient cities [Source: 5]. \nBy providing citizens with access to green spaces, promoting physical activity and healthy lifestyles, and serving as a catalyst for community engagement and social interaction, pocket parks can play a key role in creating more livable and sustainable urban environments [Source: 5].\n\nThe greening of cities is also an important aspect of creating more sustainable and resilient urban environments [Source: 5]. \nAccording to Fang Yan, the greening department is trying to make more parks around the citizens, even some street gardens and pocket parks, so that people can walk in parks not far from their homes [Source: 5].\n\nIn Shanghai, the goal is to create a three-level system of \"pocket parks - community parks - regional parks\" to provide citizens with access to green spaces [Source: 5]. \nHowever, the city still has a long way to go in terms of providing adequate green spaces for its residents, with only about 8% of the population having access to public green space [Source: 5].\n\nOverall, the benefits of small \"pocket parks\" in high-density urban settings are clear, and their design and implementation can play a key role in creating more sustainable and resilient

common in Iranian society and it was possible to watch these networks with round eyes and amazement.  But all kinds of Jam networks, as well as dozens of others, soon followed the path that Farsi One had taken, and they are still working.  Although the series that are broadcast on these networks is not Iranian, it is interesting to know that Shouder Kerry is produced, which is often shocked by the majority of its events, just like the Iranians.  Many in Turkey say the films don ’ t look anything like ordinary people ’ s lives and aren ’ t even close followers anymore.  We have said this last point to reach the productions of these days of the home screen network in Iran; products that if we are to choose a better name for most of them, we should say the works of the Turkish network!  Because exactly in these series, everything is very different from what happens in ordinary people ’ s lives and at the heart of society.  But the Iranian people are still watching these domestic products in amazement and want to see what will happen at the end of all these events that they will never see around them.  The common components of saying that the majority of the productions of the home show network in the past few years were similar to the Turkish series is a claim that must be explained.  Naturally, all that we see and read in the movies and stories are not real, the writing of the story and the script, although they should be in an atmosphere that communicates with them, but they are not supposed to be true and the imagination of the author is free to carry the story forward.  But the thing is, what happens in del, mannequin, forbidden or other series is supposed to play with the red lines of people ’ s minds and advance their story.  Apart from the fictional aspect of these series, the lifestyle that is seen in these series, the characters of these series are often rich and have a life that is not like the lives of ordinary people.  It ’ s as if all the events of these series are allegedly between the 2 percent of the population and have nothing to do with the other 98 percent.  It is interesting that as much as the face of wealth is exaggerated in these series, the face of poverty is introduced in the same form and shape, and the stories of the prince and the beggar are supposed to be able to sit the people at the feet of the narrative.  But in any case, you can ’ t escape the lifestyle that these serials advertise.  Musical instruments can be seen in the film to the extent that anyone who passes in front of the camera can play the instrument, so much so that we see that the driver of the Snap has taken his harmonica with himself and now that he has accidentally arrived at the sea, he plays for his passenger!  On the other hand, the love stories and their intertwining in these series go so far as to say that the triangle and the square of love can be understood and little terms of their knowledge.  He should have said love!  These multifaceted and extended relationships define family, commitment, friendship, and so on.  Yes, real life has bad things, and according to the old view in our culture, wolves may always be lurking, but presenting these events in the most vulgar way can make the audience surface.  So much so, that if you look at them, they will be able to see their faces, and they will be able to see their faces, and they will be able to see their faces, and they will be able to see their faces, and they will be able to see their faces.  Even more interesting is that if the time of the series is 90 minutes, in many of them, a large amount of this time refers to the previous events with the voice of a singer and the presence of music, which of course we have written a detailed report on before and we will pass it on.  In short, half the time of the film does not even go to the main line of the story, and if these shows were supposed to have referees like football, they were constantly getting red cards for killing time.  Social subjects serve to entertain the presence of a trans person as the main character or a girl who has been raped and in the culture of our society, or a son who is willing to marry a woman much older than himself to pay off his father ’ s debts, and so on.  They could be subjects that turn the show into a social work, but that doesn ’ t happen.  Social cinema is its job to inform the society of the problems, while trying to solve the problems with solutions and to promote change of approach with behavior, that is, to tell its audience that it can try to solve the problem and have a better tomorrow.  In these series, but there is no news of these roles, they use red lines and specific issues and issues only to attract more audiences and try to entertain their audience, mere entertainment that can be called cultural farce, but it has no positive effect on its audience.  These components, although seen in the commercial cinema of any country, have entered Iran with this volume and breadth after the epidemic of Turkish serials and it seems to be going to be permanent!  Turkey ’ s economic equations in neighboring countries can be seen in the words of Babak Kaidan, the author of the series “Mannequin ” and“ Del ”.  He has said about the similarity of “Mannequin ” with Turkish series:“ If we can build a series like them and become a pole of the cycle of capital that we won a lot and we should be happy, so this is not a problem, and if we forget, they are basically attracting a strong audience and have strengths that we are deceiving ourselves. ”  Serials, of course, play an important role in the economic equations of Turkey, but it is interesting to know that the people of these countries do not appear to be much of the audience of these serials.  Berna Karagozoglu studied in Iran, she has a doctorate in Persian literature, and recently, in an interview with Jam-e Jam, she emphasized that she does not watch Turkish series and is surprised when people ask her about these questions.  He added: “Our people don ’ t see these shows very much because they don ’ t look like their lives.  He stressed that the beautiful houses seen in the shows, the open and free relationships that are being promoted, the love triangles that are constantly being repeated and many other things have no place in the lives of Turkish people.  In addition, if we have the experience of traveling to Turkey or living in this country, we soon realize that the level of life and religious beliefs in the majority of the country ’ s society is different from the image that is displayed in these series, and people go their own way, and these series follow their own path.  The same series, which are not very popular in Turkey, are playing with the cultural identity of their neighbors.  In some surrounding countries, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, the arrangement of houses is determined by the Turkish series, meaning that Turkey sends many of its goods to neighboring countries, goods that previously need to be present in the houses and have customers.  Clothing stores are also controlled by Turkey.  Can the home theater network in Iran, according to Kaidan, create such an atmosphere, and does it even want to break social definitions in Iran and in countries that have much stronger conventional lines than us in many issues and gain economic and profit?  It ’ s a question we all know the answer to …  These non-Iranian Iranian series, just as people watched Persian One series with round eyes a decade and a half ago, have watched similar homegrown productions with rounded eyes since a year or two ago, and then the trend has continued until they get used to watching them and follow them.  Iranian series that are based on exactly the same Turkish series, with the same crises and shortcomings and the same useless attractions.  They don ’ t have stories because they don ’ t have good writers.  Today ’ s writers of home theater networks do not know how to tell stories, so they want to attract audiences by adding sexual elements and showing aristocratic life.  Their stories are not written to generate economic outings in other countries, nor to cure the pain of the people watching them.  This series has an internal address and an internal turnover.  It has internal damage and internal damage.  Their narratives do not resemble the lives of people, they are far from the heart of society, and of course, it can be said that like the adventures of luxury theater and concerts, some people earn money and go for a while.  But what about their cultural impact?  Does it wash away so easily?  And more importantly, are those who give permission to these shows ready to sit down in front of the media one day and give their opinion about them?  Do the honorable directors even look at what they are promoting and what consequences it will have for society when they sign a license?

Turkey ’ s economic equations in neighboring countries can be seen in the words of Babak Kaidan, the author of the series “Mannequin ” and“ Del ”.  He has said about the similarity of “Mannequin ” with Turkish series:“ If we can build a series like them and become a pole of the cycle of capital that we won a lot and we should be happy, so this is not a problem, and if we forget, they are basically attracting a strong audience and have strengths that we are deceiving ourselves. ”  Serials, of course, play an important role in the economic equations of Turkey, but it is interesting to know that the people of these countries do not appear to be much of the audience of these serials.  Berna Karagozoglu studied in Iran, she has a doctorate in Persian literature, and recently, in an interview with Jam-e Jam, she emphasized that she does not watch Turkish series and is surprised when people ask her about these questions.  He added: “Our people don ’ t see these shows very much because they don ’ t look like their lives.  He stressed that the beautiful houses seen in the shows, the open and free relationships that are being promoted, the love triangles that are constantly being repeated and many other things have no place in the lives of Turkish people.  In addition, if we have the experience of traveling to Turkey or living in this country, we soon realize that the level of life and religious beliefs in the majority of the country ’ s society is different from the image that is displayed in these series, and people go their own way, and these series follow their own path.  The same series, which are not very popular in Turkey, are playing with the cultural identity of their neighbors.  In some surrounding countries, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, the arrangement of houses is determined by the Turkish series, meaning that Turkey sends many of its goods to neighboring countries, goods that previously need to be present in the houses and have customers.  Clothing stores are also controlled by Turkey.  Can the home theater network in Iran, according to Kaidan, create such an atmosphere, and does it even want to break social definitions in Iran and in countries that have much stronger conventional lines than us in many issues and gain economic and profit?  It ’ s a question we all know the answer to …  These non-Iranian Iranian series, just as people watched Persian One series with round eyes a decade and a half ago, have watched similar homegrown productions with rounded eyes since a year or two ago, and then the trend has continued until they get used to watching them and follow them.  Iranian series that are based on exactly the same Turkish series, with the same crises and shortcomings and the same useless attractions.  They don ’ t have stories because they don ’ t have good writers.  Today ’ s writers of home theater networks do not know how to tell stories, so they want to attract audiences by adding sexual elements and showing aristocratic life.  Their stories are not written to generate economic outings in other countries, nor to cure the pain of the people watching them.  This series has an internal address and an internal turnover.  It has internal damage and internal damage.  Their narratives do not resemble the lives of people, they are far from the heart of society, and of course, it can be said that like the adventures of luxury theater and concerts, some people earn money and go for a while.  But what about their cultural impact?  Does it wash away so easily?  And more importantly, are those who give permission to these shows ready to sit down in front of the media one day and give their opinion about them?  Do the honorable directors even look at what they are promoting and what consequences it will have for society when they sign a license?

execution. \nOne of the key components of a sustainable atmosphere is the production of oxygen, which is essential for human life support [Source: 1].\n\nNASA's Mars rover, Perseverance, has successfully demonstrated the ability to extract oxygen from the Martian atmosphere using the Mars Oxygen In-situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) [Source: 1]. \nMOXIE is a toaster-sized instrument that converts carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbon monoxide [Source: 7]. \nThe experiment was conducted on April 20, the 60th day since the landing of the mission to Mars [Source: 1].\n\nThe MOXIE device uses electrolysis to break down carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbon monoxide [Source: 7]. \nThe process involves capturing carbon dioxide, passing it through a filter to remove dust, and then compressing it to provide pressure at ground level [Source: 7]. \nThe gas then passes through a heated electrolysis cell, which consists of several layers of nickel alloy and ceramics [Source: 7].\n\nThe MOXIE technology has the potential to provide astronauts with oxygen for breathing and fuel for rocket propulsion [Source: 7]. \nThe device is capable of producing up to 10 grams of oxygen per hour, which is a significant improvement over previous oxygen-generating experiments [Source: 7].\n\nHowever, creating a sustainable atmosphere on Mars is not just about producing oxygen. \nIt also requires the production of other essential resources, such as water and food [Source: 8]. \nNASA is working on developing technologies to extract water from Martian soil and ice [Source: 8]. \nThe agency is also exploring ways to produce food on Mars using hydroponics and aeroponics [Source: 8].\n\nIn terms of worst-case scenarios, NASA engineers are planning for the possibility of equipment failure and power outages [Source: 9]. \nThe agency is also preparing for the possibility of contamination by Earth-based microorganisms [Source: 10]. \nHowever, researchers believe that sending Earth microbes to Mars could be beneficial for creating a habitable environment [Source: 9].\n\nThe largest number of people that could be sustained by the atmosphere on Mars is not yet known. \nHowever, NASA engineers are planning for a sustainable atmosphere that could support a team of up to 250,000 people [Source: 2]. \nThe agency is working on developing technologies to extract resources from Martian soil and ice, which could support a large population [Source: 2].\n\nIn terms of incorporating local materials, NASA's MOXIE experiment uses the Martian atmosphere as a source of carbon dioxide [Source: 1]. \nThe experiment also uses Martian regolith, a mixture of minerals created on Mars, to simulate the planet's surface conditions [Source: 10]. \nHowever, the use of local materials is still in its infancy, and more research is needed to develop sustainable technologies for creating a habitable environment on Mars [Source: 10].\n\nIn conclusion, creating a sustainable atmosphere on Mars requires careful planning and execution. \nNASA's MOXIE experiment has demonstrated the ability to extract oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, but more research is needed to develop sustainable technologies for creating a habitable environment. \nThe agency is working on developing technologies to extract resources from Martian soil and ice, which could support

company, has been facing numerous lawsuits in the United States related to its Roundup herbicide, which has been accused of causing cancer [Source: 1].\n\nThe lawsuits have resulted in tens of thousands of claims, with plaintiffs alleging that exposure to Roundup has led to the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other cancers [Source: 2]. \nIn an effort to settle these claims, Bayer has reached an agreement with plaintiffs' lawyers to pay approximately $10.5 billion [Source: 1].\n\nAs part of this agreement, Bayer will pay about $9.5 billion to settle claims filed by lawyers representing some 95,000 plaintiffs [Source: 1]. \nThe company will also set aside an additional $1.1 billion to establish and fund a panel to assess whether the product causes cancer, with the goal of influencing the outcome of future litigation [Source: 1].\n\nBayer's offer to settle the claims was initially reported to be around $8 billion, but the company ultimately agreed to pay $10.5 billion to settle the claims [Source: 2]. \nThe settlement is a significant milestone for the company, which has been facing declining share prices and shareholder dissatisfaction due to the ongoing lawsuits [Source: 1].\n\nThe Roundup herbicide was previously owned by Monsanto, which was acquired by Bayer in a $63 billion deal [Source: 2]. \nAs a result of the acquisition, Bayer is now responsible for defending the company against lawsuits related to the herbicide [Source: 2].\n\nIn addition to the financial settlement, the agreement also includes provisions for Bayer to establish a panel to assess the safety of the product and to provide compensation to affected individuals [Source: 1]. \nThe panel will be responsible for reviewing the scientific evidence related to the safety of Roundup and providing recommendations for future litigation [Source: 1].\n\nThe settlement is a significant development in the ongoing litigation related to Roundup, and it is likely to have a major impact on the company's financial performance and reputation [Source: 1]. \nThe agreement demonstrates Bayer's commitment to resolving the claims and providing compensation to affected individuals, and it is a major step towards resolving the ongoing litigation [Source: 1].\n\nIn related news, a recent study found that all 10 flavors of e-cigarettes tested caused some level of toxicity in the cells lining the lungs, which in some cases led to their death [Source: 8]. \nThe study highlights the potential risks associated with the use of e-cigarettes, particularly in terms of

\nThe report estimates that the protein content in these crops can be reduced by 6% to 14% [Source: 1]. \nThis can lead to an increase in the number of people at risk of protein deficiency, with nearly 150 million more people affected than today [Source: 1].\n\nClimate change also affects the distribution of water resources, leading to droughts and water scarcity in some regions [Source: 3]. \nIn Kazakhstan, the reduction of water resources is predicted to be 25% by 2030 [Source: 3]. \nThis can have significant impacts on agricultural productivity and food security.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that 80 million more people will be at risk of hunger by 2050 than today [Source: 1]. \nThis is due to a combination of factors, including changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, and increased competition for water resources.\n\nIn India, up to 40% of rice-producing areas are feared to be unsuitable for farming due to climate change [Source: 1]. \nThis can lead to reduced crop yields and increased food prices, making it difficult for low-income households to access nutritious food.\n\nClimate change can also lead to the displacement of people, with studies estimating that between 30 million and 140 million people will be displaced in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America by 2050 [Source: 2]. \nThis can have significant social and economic impacts, particularly for vulnerable communities.\n\nIn addition to these impacts, climate change can also lead to the loss of biodiversity, with many plant and animal species facing extinction due to changing environmental conditions [Source: 4]. \nThis can have significant impacts on ecosystem services, including pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling.\n\nThe IPCC report emphasizes the need for urgent action to address the impacts of climate change on agriculture and food security [Source: 1]. \nThis includes promoting sustainable

197.8-kilometer race [Source: 1]. \nHowever, the event was marred by two serious car accidents, one of which was caused by a spectator who deliberately derailed several cyclists [Source: 1].\n\nThe first incident occurred 45 kilometers away from the finish line, when a woman wearing a bright yellow coat and holding up sunglasses stood beside the track with a card written on the cheering words, apparently facing the live camera [Source: 1]. \nThe card read \"allez opi omi\" in French and German, meaning to say hello to grandparents [Source: 3]. \nThe woman's position and the cards in her hands were clearly too close to the track, and she did not notice the approaching cyclists [Source: 1].\n\nAs the main train group arrived, German driver Tony Martin hit the card and fell to the ground, becoming the beginning of a series of chaos [Source: 1]. \nThe selfishness of the woman in yellow not only caused two hot spots for the championship but also caused nine drivers to injure, including German driver Jasha Suetterlin, who had to retire and was unable to compete in the second leg [Source: 1].\n\nThe incident was not an isolated case, as another accident occurred 8 kilometers from the end, due to the accident on the high-speed section, up to 12 people were injured, and the injury is also serious [Source: 2]. \nThe famous Chris Froome will withdraw, Swiss driver Marc Hirschi also suffered a serious shoulder injury, his UAE team mate, last Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar, even though he finished sixth, he still looked sad: “Today was not good at all, there were a lot of accidents, and my teammates were not in very good condition” [Source: 2].\n\nThe woman who caused the car to be fried immediately fled and disappeared [Source: 1]. \nPierre-Yves Thouault, the deputy director of the Tour de France, will go to the end: “We will prosecute this woman who has behaved badly, and only by doing so can we deter that little bad person” [Source: 1].\n\nAn investigation was initiated by the gendarmerie of the French Finistère, and the woman was wanted for charges of “clearly and deliberately violating the duty of care and accidentally causing short-term harm” [Source: 4]. \nThe organizers of the Tour de France have also promised to take legal action against the woman, saying that \"we are suing this woman who has behaved so badly, and we are doing this so that the few who have done so will not spoil the events of others\" [Source: 7].\n\nThe incident was not a one-time occurrence, as there were other incidents during the event, including a blockage caused by a fan who held up a sign and stood very close to the roadway [Source: 8]. \nThe fan, who was later arrested, was accused of causing a domino effect, and several cyclists collided with each other, creating a rather serious collision [Source: 8].\n\nThe incident highlights the importance of road safety and the need for spectators to be aware of their surroundings, especially during high-speed events like the Tour de France [Source: 9]. \nThe organizers of the event have promised to take measures to prevent such incidents in the future, including increasing security and reminding fans to stay on the side of the road [Source: 9].\n\nIn conclusion, the deliberate derailment of cyclists during the Tour de France was a serious incident that caused injuries and disruption to the event. \nThe incident highlights the need for spectators to be aware of their surroundings and to respect the safety of the athletes [Source: 1]. \nThe organizers of the event have promised to take measures to prevent such incidents in the future, and the woman who caused the incident will face charges for her actions [Source: 4].\n"}

due to several reasons.\n\nThe country officially withdrew from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) on Sunday, June 30, after 32 years to restart commercial whaling [Source: 8]. \nThis decision was made after Japan's Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Takayama Yoshikawa, said that the resumption of whaling was the \"sad wish of the people involved in the national whaling\" [Source: 1].\n\nOne of the main reasons for Japan's decision to resume whaling is to revitalize the economy [Source: 8]. \nSome areas that used to make a living from whaling also hope to revitalize the economy by restarting whale hunting, such as the Amikawa area in the east of Miyagi Prefecture, which was the base of the whaling port of that year [Source: 8].\n\nWhale meat is quite nutritious and has become an important food item for the Japanese since the end of World War II [Source: 8]. \nHowever, the annual consumption of whale meat in Japan since the 1990s has been about 2,000 to 6,000 tons, and the latest figure in 2018 totals 3,000 tons [Source: 8].\n\nThe resumption of commercial whaling is also seen as a way to maintain the existence of the whaling industry [Source: 5]. \nThe Japanese government is doing this mainly out of domestic political considerations [Source: 5]. \nFor example, Japan's current prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was born in Yamaguchi Prefecture, a whaling prefecture [Source: 5].\n\nWhaling has been a part of Japan's culture for centuries, and the country has a long history of whaling, which began in prehistoric times [Source: 8]. \nIn the Edo period, whaling gradually became an industry [Source: 8]. \nVarious parts of the whale were fully utilized, such as whale oil as a pesticide, bone nata as carving, and ambergris as a perfume [Source: 8].\n\nThe resumption of commercial whaling is also seen as a way to gain the support of local residents [Source: 5]. \nThe constituency of the former president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's faction, the \"Chi Shih Association\", is a land of whaling [Source: 5].\n\nHowever, the actual market demand for whale meat is not high [Source: 8]. \nThe price of whale meat is not particularly expensive due to the low supply and demand [Source: 8]. \nIn the Tokyo market price in 2018, the price of \"red meat level 1\" whale meat used for sashimi is 1,600 yen (about HK $110) per kilogram, and the price of \"umu\" whale meat used for high-grade smoked is 3,000 yen (about HK $210) per kilogram [Source: 8].\n\nThe resumption of commercial whaling has also been criticized by international environmental groups [Source: 8]. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has warned people that high levels of mercury in dolphin meat can cause diseases such as cancer, infertility, and

United States can cost an average of $4,800, while in Thailand, the same procedure can cost around $1,600 [Source: 9].\n\nThe global market for cosmetic surgery is expected to grow steadily, with estimates suggesting that the global market will reach $142 billion by 2026 [Source: 5]. \nThe growth of this sector is primarily driven by increasing awareness of health facilities and services, particularly among citizens of higher-income countries [Source: 5].\n\nHowever, the growth of cosmetic surgery tourism also poses several challenges. \nOne of the major concerns is the lack of regulation and oversight in many of these countries, which can lead to substandard care and increased risk of complications [Source: 9].\n\nAnother challenge is the cultural and linguistic barriers that can exist between patients and healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications [Source: 9].\n\nFurthermore, the rise of social media has created unrealistic beauty standards, which can lead to a surge in demand for cosmetic surgery [Source: 9].\n\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the cosmetic surgery tourism industry, with many countries imposing travel restrictions and lockdowns [Source: 5].\n\nDespite these challenges, many individuals continue to travel abroad for cosmetic surgery, citing the lower costs and faster turnaround times as major advantages [Source: 8].\n\nThe destinations for cosmetic surgery tourism also vary depending on the procedure. \nFor example, hair transplantation is a popular procedure in Turkey, with many individuals traveling there for this procedure [Source: 9].\n\nIn terms of costs, the average check for a foreign patient in Ukrainian clinics increased to $2,800 in 2019, with prices varying depending on the region and type of procedure [Source: 7].\n\nOverall, the scale and impact of medical tourism for cosmetic surgery are significant, with both benefits and challenges associated with this trend [Source: 8].\n\nBenefits for individuals traveling for cosmetic surgery include lower costs and faster turnaround times [Source: 8]. \nAdditionally, many individuals report feeling more confident and self-assured after undergoing cosmetic surgery [Source: 9].\n\nHowever, the risks associated with cosmetic surgery tourism are significant, including the potential for substandard care, cultural and linguistic barriers, and the impact of social media on beauty standards [Source: 9].\n\nIn terms of destinations, Brazil, South Korea, Turkey, and Hungary are among the most popular destinations for cosmetic surgery [Source: 9].\n\nThe most common procedures for cosmetic surgery tourism include liposuction, abdominoplasty, and buttock augmentation [Source: 9].\n\nOverall, the trend of medical tourism for cosmetic surgery is expected to continue, with many individuals traveling abroad for this purpose [Source: 8].\n\nThe global market for cosmetic surgery is expected to reach $142 billion by 2026 [Source: 5].\n\nIn conclusion, cosmetic surgery is a significant aspect of medical tourism, with both benefits and challenges associated with this trend [Source: 8].\n\nThe destinations for cosmetic surgery tourism vary depending on the procedure, with Brazil, South Korea, Turkey, and Hungary among the most popular destinations [Source:

requires careful planning and consideration of various factors, including the equipment needed, worst-case scenarios, and the largest number of people that can be sustained by the atmosphere.\n\nTo create a sustainable atmosphere on Mars, it is essential to use local materials whenever possible. \nOne such example is the use of cyanobacteria, which can thrive in Martian atmospheric conditions and provide a source of carbon and oxygen [Source: 20]. \nThese microorganisms can be grown in a bioreactor, such as the Atmos bioreactor developed by researchers at the University of Bremen in Germany [Source: 26]. \nThe bioreactor maintains atmospheric pressure at 10 percent of Earth's and nitrogen and carbon dioxide concentrations of 96 percent and 4 percent, respectively [Source: 26]. \nWater and a mixture of minerals mimicking Martian regolith were also added to the bioreactor [Source: 26].\n\nAnother example of local materials used in creating a sustainable atmosphere on Mars is the use of Martian dust, which can be used to feed other living organisms [Source: 20]. \nCyanobacteria, such as Anabaena sp. \nPCC 7938, can multiply in water with a suspension of Martian dust [Source: 26]. \nThese microorganisms can support life by using the gases of the Martian atmosphere as a source of carbon and oxygen, despite the low pressure [Source: 26].\n\nIn addition to using

that can produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere [Source: 19].\n\nNASA's oxygen-generating experiment on Mars, known as MOXIE, is a prime example of a device that can produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere [Source: 19]. \nMOXIE uses extreme heat to separate oxygen atoms from carbon dioxide molecules through electrolysis [Source: 19]. \nThe device is the size of a conventional toaster and can produce up to 10 grams of oxygen per hour [Source: 19]. \nMOXIE was successfully tested on April 20, and the results showed that the device can produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere

people could be sustained by a self-sufficient ecosystem on Mars [Source: 10]. \nThis estimate is based on the idea that a large enough population would be able to produce its own food, water, and energy, reducing the need for external resources [Source: 10].\n\nIn conclusion, creating a sustainable atmosphere on Mars requires careful planning and consideration of various factors, including the

are taking on new dimensions.  A company called ABIBOO recently unveiled its plan to build the first Martian city.  The architecture firm Abybo has completed its plan to build the first Martian city.  The first large Martian town, called Nüwa City, can accommodate 250,000 people and will be built along and inside a massive rock.  Where people will have access to sunlight without being exposed to the risk of deadly cosmic radiation.  The Martian city ’ s massive lunar and Martian corridors, a suitable place for human habitation, could begin construction by 2054, and its first potential settlers are likely to move there by 2100.  As seen in the city ’ s renderings, the interiors of Noah ’ s luxurious rooms are spectacular regardless of whether the target for 2100 is realistic or not.  According to Abibo, the company is considering the necessary arrangements for how a Martian city will operate independently and meet its needs.  Sitting next to a cliff allows expats to live in private homes and other parts of the city to be used for farming, animal husbandry and energy supply, such as the use of solar arrays.  The goal is to build a sustainable civilization on the surface of Mars that can survive without the need for continuous transportation with Earth.  However, there is no exact plan for how this idea will work.  It will certainly be a difficult path to follow.  Atmospheric pressure on Mars is 1% of Earth ’ s pressure, extremely cold temperatures and high cosmic radiation, so that any skin exposed to it would burn.  Alfredo Muñoz, founder of Abibo Architecture Studio, said: “We had to do a lot of research based on computation and working with scientists to figure out what kind of conditions we would face on Mars.  \"Obviously, we have to face challenges that are completely specific to the conditions on Mars, and one of them is the activity in gravity of only a third of Earth's gravity.\"  Despite these challenges, there is fortunately carbon dioxide and water on the surface of Mars.  Munoz added, “Water is one of the great advantages we have on Mars and helps us get the right materials for construction.  \"Basically, with water and carbon dioxide, we can make carbon, and with carbon, we can make steel.\"  In addition, efforts such as the production of oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, which was first carried out by the Mars rover's MAXI instrument, have raised hopes of a stable presence on Mars.  Abybo's plan is to use only Martian material to build the first Martian settlement.  The New City of Noah on Mars project is part of a larger science program organized by the Mars Society in collaboration with SONet, an international team of scientists and academics.  Munoz explained, “What we learn as we move on to develop a fully sustainable city on Mars will give us good ideas and insights about what we can do differently on Earth. ”  Many people are interested in a stable human presence on Mars.  From Carl Sagan to Robert Zubrin, to Mars enthusiast Elon Musk, to SpaceX CEO.  While some estimates by Elon Musk seem too ambitious, there is a growing consensus that any future city on Mars will eventually have to be self-sufficient.  Otherwise, the people on the Red Planet will never be independent of Earth.

overview of the potential harms caused by the herbicide Roundup, developed by Monsanto, and the financial implications for producers such as Bayer.\n\nRoundup, a widely used herbicide, has been linked to cancer in several individuals and organizations worldwide. \nAccording to a jury in San Francisco, Edwin Hardeman contracted cancer as a result of using Roundup [Source: 1].\n\nIn the United States, there are approximately 18,400 claims against Bayer related to Roundup cases [Source: 5]. \nThe total aggregate payments for all claims could exceed $5 billion [Source: 5].\n\nIn the first stage of the trial, only evidence of the potential harm of Roundup and its active substance, glyphosate, was considered [Source: 1]. \nIn the second phase of the trial, six jurors must determine whether Monsanto should be held accountable for the harm caused to Edwin Hardeman [Source: 1].\n\nBayer has faced significant financial losses due to the Roundup lawsuits. \nThe company has pledged to pay $10.9 billion in court compensation for cancer patients from the herbicide Roundup [Source: 2].\n\nA jury in California ordered Bayer to pay $289.2 million to school gardener Diwayne Johnson, who contracted cancer as a result of using the herbicide Roundup [Source: 3]. \nThe amount was later reduced to $78.5 million due to Bayer's appeal [Source: 3].\n\nIn August 2018, a court in the United States ruled that Bayer should pay $289.2 million to school gardener Diwayne Johnson, who contracted cancer as a result of using the herbicide Roundup [Source: 3].\n\nBayer has also faced financial losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe company reported a net loss of $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020 [Source: 2].\n\nThe company's sales in the pharmaceutical sector decreased by 6.1%

affecting crop yields and changing the growing conditions for various crops. \nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the average global temperature has risen by about 1 degree Celsius since the late 19th century [Source: 1].\n\nTemperature changes are affecting the growth and development of crops. \nRising temperatures during the growing season are causing rice to be unable to pollinate, leading to reduced crop yields [Source: 2]. \nHigh temperatures and rainfall are also making the soil unable to maintain nutrients, reducing crop yields and increasing production costs [Source: 2].\n\nShifts in rainfall patterns are also affecting agriculture. \nIn Latin America, where the region produces enough food to meet the needs of all its inhabitants, food prices remained high for a seventh consecutive month in the last month of 2020, with dairy products and vegetable oils driving the biggest price increases [Source: 1]. \nThis is due to higher demand and weaker dollar values, but also exacerbated by the impact of the epidemic on the supply chain and the restriction of traffic [Source: 1].\n\nClimate change is also affecting the growth of trees and corals, the abundance and geographical distribution of animal and plant species, the chemistry of oceans and lakes, and the accumulation of ice in cold areas [Source: 3]. \nThese changes are a result of climate change, which is causing global temperature increases and uneven rainfall [Source: 3].\n\nIn addition, climate change is affecting the health and well-being of people, particularly vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and people in low-income communities [Source: 3]. \nThe increase in temperature is also affecting the risk of diseases, such as dengue fever, which is expected to increase to 86% in Taiwan if the average temperature rises by 1 degree Celsius [Source: 2].\n\nTo mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture, researchers from the University of Oxford suggest that modifying the way food is produced could be a good way to reduce global warming and climate change [Source: 7]. \nThis includes replacing fossil fuels with environmentally friendly fuels and changing agricultural practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [Source: 7].\n\nFurthermore, climate change is affecting the land and its ability to absorb carbon. \nThe land is often abused and contributes to the harm of climate change [Source: 10]. \nGlobal soils can currently absorb 1% of carbon, down from 7% in the past [Source: 10]. \nThis is due to human behavior, which has changed the land from carbon capture to carbon release [Source: 10].\n\nIn conclusion, climate change is having a significant impact on agriculture worldwide. \nRising temperatures, shifts in rainfall patterns, and changes in carbon dioxide levels are affecting crop yields, growing conditions, and the health and well-being of people. \nTo mitigate these effects, researchers suggest modifying agricultural practices and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nReferences:\n\n[Source: 1]\n[Source: 2]\n[Source: 3]\n[Source: 7]\n[Source: 10]\n"}

significant concern. \nIn 2018, the death rate among migrants attempting to cross the English Channel was one death for every three people who reached Europe alive [Source: 6]. \nThis highlights the need for increased efforts to prevent such incidents and ensure the safety of those attempting to cross the Channel.\n\nIf asylum seekers are successful in reaching the British side of the Channel, they are often met with a range of challenges. \nMany are taken into custody by the UK authorities, with some being held in detention centers [Source: 9]. \nThe UK government has also implemented a range of measures to deter asylum seekers from attempting to cross the Channel, including increased patrols and searches [Source: 8].\n\nIn response to the growing number of asylum seekers attempting to cross the Channel, France has also increased its efforts to prevent such incidents. \nThe French authorities have announced that they will be working more closely with the UK to prevent asylum seekers from attempting to cross the Channel [Source: 7]. \nThe French government has also increased its own efforts to deter asylum seekers, including deploying more patrols and searching vessels [Source: 7].\n\nIn addition to the efforts of France and the UK, the European Union has also taken steps to address the issue of asylum seekers attempting to cross the English Channel. \nThe EU has agreed to increase its efforts to support member states in preventing asylum seekers from attempting to cross the Channel [Source: 6]. \nThe EU has also increased its funding for search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, with the aim of reducing the number of asylum seekers attempting to cross the Channel [Source: 6].\n\nThe United Nations has also highlighted the need for increased efforts to address the issue of asylum seekers attempting to cross the English Channel. \nIn a recent report, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called for urgent reforms in the search and rescue policies and actions taken by Libya, the European Union, and its member states to ensure that such policies and measures are complied with international law [Source: 9].\n\nOverall, the issue of asylum seekers attempting to cross the English Channel is a complex and challenging one. \nHowever, by working together, France, the UK, and the European Union can take steps to prevent such incidents and ensure the safety of those attempting to cross the Channel [Source: 8].\n"}

after 32 years, citing the need to study whale migration routes, diet, and other factors related to marine mammals [Source: 7]. \nThe country's withdrawal from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was announced in December 2018, and it officially re-opened the \"tradition\" of commercial whaling for 31 years on July 1, 2019 [Source: 2].\n\nOne of the main reasons for Japan's decision to resume whaling is the need to support the country's whaling industry, which has been aging and struggling financially [Source: 6]. \nThe Japanese government has allocated a fixed subsidy to whalers every day, which will likely be cut or even cancelled in 2020 [Source: 6]. \nBy resuming commercial whaling, the government hopes to guarantee the repayment of funds and ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry [Source: 6].\n\nAnother reason for Japan's decision is the country's cultural heritage and traditional practice of whaling [Source: 4]. \nWhaling has been an integral part of Japanese culture for centuries, with the country's whaling industry dating back to the Edo period [Source: 4]. \nThe Japanese government argues that eating whale meat is a national tradition and a way to preserve the country's cultural identity [Source: 5].\n\nThe Japanese government has also pointed to the low supply and demand of whale meat as a reason for resuming commercial whaling [Source: 5]. \nDespite the decline in demand, whale meat is not expensive due to reduced availability, and the price of whale meat is comparable to that of other meats [Source: 5]. \nThe government hopes that by resuming commercial whaling, the industry will be able to increase its production and meet the growing demand for whale meat [Source: 5].\n\nIn addition, Japan's withdrawal from the IWC has allowed the country to resume whaling in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone [Source: 8]. \nThe government has also established a new category of \"survey whaling\" to continue whaling on the grounds of \"scientific research\" [Source: 2]. \nThis move has been met with criticism from environmental groups and other countries, which argue that Japan's actions are effectively a cover for commercial whaling [Source: 5].\n\nThe Japanese government has also emphasized the importance of whaling in supporting the country's fishing industry [Source: 7]. \nWhaling has been an important source of protein for Japanese people, particularly during times of food shortages and economic hardship [Source: 4]. \nThe government hopes that by resuming commercial whaling, the industry will be able to contribute to the country's economic growth and food security [Source: 7].\n\nOverall, Japan's decision to resume commercial whaling is a complex issue with multiple motivations and implications. \nWhile the country's cultural heritage and traditional practice of whaling are significant factors, the need to support the country's whaling industry and address the low supply and demand of whale meat are also important considerations [Source: 5].\n\nWhale hunting has brought some whale species to the brink of extinction [Source: 5]. \nThe International Whaling Commission (IWC) has banned commercial whaling since 1986 because some whale species are threatened with extinction [Source: 5]. \nHowever, Japan has been hunting whales under the guise of scientific research, and the country's withdrawal from the IWC has allowed it to resume commercial whaling [Source: 5].\n\nIn 2014, the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan's Antarctic whaling program was not for scientific and research purposes and therefore had to be stopped [Source: 9]. \nHowever, the Japanese government has argued that its whaling program is necessary for the country's food security and sustainable development [Source: 6].\n\nWhaling has been a contentious issue for many years, with both proponents and opponents presenting different arguments and evidence [Source: 5]. \nThe debate surrounding whaling is complex and multifaceted, involving issues of cultural heritage, food security, economic development, and environmental conservation [Source: 5].\n\nThe resumption of commercial whaling by Japan has been met with criticism from many countries, including Australia, Brazil, and other IWC member countries [Source: 8]. \nThese countries argue that Japan's actions are unsustainable and will have negative impacts on whale populations and the environment [Source: 8]. \nHowever, the Japanese government argues that its whaling program is necessary for the country's

American writer, born in Oak Park, Illinois, who is famous for his unique writing style characterized by polished and concise language.\n\nHemingway's writing style is often described as simple and clear, yet powerful and evocative. \nHe believed that \"the sayings must be said in the unspoken\" [Source: 1]. \nThis philosophy is reflected in his writing, where he omits unnecessary words to convey a powerful message.\n\nHemingway's literary style is often compared to an iceberg, with only a small portion of the text visible above the surface [Source: 5]. \nThis analogy was popularized by Hemingway himself, who said that \"prose is like architecture, not interior decoration\" [Source: 3]. \nAccording to Hemingway, if a writer has a clear idea of what they want to convey, they can omit unnecessary details and still create a powerful impression on the reader.\n\nHemingway's writing style has been praised for its ability to convey complex emotions and ideas through simple, concise language. \nHis use of short sentences and sparse descriptions creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy, drawing the reader into the world of the story [Source: 3].\n\nMany critics have praised Hemingway's writing style, saying that it is a hallmark of his unique literary voice. \nAccording to one critic, \"Hemingway's writing is like a scalpel, cutting through the noise and getting to the heart of the matter\" [Source: 5].\n\nDespite the simplicity of his writing style, Hemingway's works are often complex and layered, with multiple themes and motifs woven throughout the text. \nHis use of symbolism, imagery, and other literary devices adds depth and complexity to his writing, making it more than just a simple, straightforward narrative [Source: 3].\n\nHemingway's writing style has also been influenced by his experiences as a journalist and war correspondent. \nHis time in the trenches of World War I and the Spanish Civil War had a profound impact on his writing, shaping his views on war, humanity, and the nature of reality [Source: 4].\n\nIn conclusion, Ernest Hemingway's writing style is a unique and powerful blend of simplicity, clarity, and complexity. \nHis use of concise language, sparse descriptions, and literary devices creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy, drawing the reader into the world of the story. \nWhether writing about war, humanity, or the natural world, Hemingway's writing style is a hallmark of his literary voice and a testament to his enduring legacy as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century [Source: 1].\n\nHemingway's writing style is also characterized by its honesty and directness. \nHe believed that \"the only thing that interests anyone is how you get away with it\" [Source: 4]. \nThis philosophy is reflected in his writing, where he often presents a raw and unvarnished view of the world, without apology or pretension.\n\nHemingway's writing style has been praised for its ability to convey complex emotions
